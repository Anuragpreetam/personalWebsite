        <h1>About Me </h1>
        <p>Well, I'm an Engineer turning into an <b>MBA</b> now. I was so much into software Engineering but 
            I wanted to learn how the business side of things work and also how to manage a product development and things like that so I opted for an MBA
        </p>  
    </div>

    <div class="jumbotron" id="education">
        <h1>Education </h1>
        <p>        
            I Graduated B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with <b>70%</b> from JNTUH in 2018.
            Now doing an MBA from GuruNanak Business School in Hyderabad and I should be graduating in 2022 hopefully.
        </p>

    <div class="jumbotron" id="projects">
        <h1>Projects </h1>
        <h2>SecretBook</h2>
        <p>
            An android application where you can write anything you want just like a diary but this is a digital one,
            we provided security to it by adding authentication and encrypting the data. So you're password works as the key for encryption and it decrypts every single time
            you open the application and type in you're password.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Fire Detection</h2>
        <p>
            In today's world we see many news articles about fire accidents as the buildings do not have 
            proper fire detecting systems in place and even though some buildings have sensors but still 
            we see accidents because the sensors work in such a way that only if smoke reaches them only then they
            alert us, so we wanted to reduce the delay in notifying so we developed this desktop application
            that uses computer vision to detect fire and it is fast and accurate.  
        </p>

        <h2>ToDo List</h2>
        <p>I made this project as a part of learning JavaScript.
            A simple ToDo list styled using bootstrap. 
            Everything happens in the client side.
        </p>

        <h2>Color Game</h2>
        <p> 
            This too was made as a part of learning JavaScript but it was slightly more 
            complex than ToDo list. 
            You’re presented with a 2*3 grid containing colors and on the top you’re presented with rgb code, so you need to pick the right color according to the rgb code.
        </p>

        <h2>Camp Grounds</h2>
        <p>
            A fullStack application made using MEN stack (Mongo, Express, NodeJs). 
            If you’re looking for a  nice place to camp for the weekend then it’s the
            right app for you. 
            Built authentication using PassportJs and there is also a comment section for every
            campground which displays the comment as well as the name of the user 
            that posted that comment.
        </p>

        <h2>Simple Search</h2>
        <p>
            A search app to search any stuff related to movies stored inside the DataBase.
            You can also edit and delete a record from the DataBase.
        </p>

        <h2> Student Management System</h2>
        <p>
           A fullStack application made using MEN stack (Mongo, Express, NodeJs). It has both Authentication and Authorisation built into it. For Authorisation of Student/Teacher we made use of OAuth with PassportJs (Added SignIn with google and SignIn with Github). 
           For Authorisation of admin we used JWT(Json Web Tokens).
           This web app can be used to manage all the Student Details especially his/her grades. 
           For Authorisation of Student/Teacher we used RoleBasedAccessControl.
